## Code Refactor Example

```css
div{
  width: 300px;
  border: 50px;
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  padding: 10x;
  margin: 10px;
  border-style: groove;
  color: rgb(21, 93, 93);
  background: linear-gradient(darksalmon, #740001);
}
```

```html
<main>

        <section class = "space">
          <div class = "space-container">
            <a href="https://github.com/bdalberson">
                <img src="./assets/Me.png"  class = "image" alt="picture of myself"/>
                </a>
          </div>

```


## Learning Points 

Wow, learned so much.  How to skeleton a page in HTML.  How to select sections and style them with CSS.  So much feels like trial and error at this point but I hope to get more consistent in the future.  Once there's some forms and interaction I'll be able to put some of my scripting skills to use.
